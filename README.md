# Drum Machine App

## Project Description

This app renders a drum machine with a basic nine button layout and controllers. You can click on each drum pad to reproduce the listed sound, or you can use the buttons Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X and C instead. You can also use the control box to switch between two different banks of sounds, to switch the power of the device, and to adjust the volume of the app.

## Technology Stack

- Basic HTML5 for the app entry point.
- CSS
- React
- Vite
- Node Package Manager
- Node.js

You are free to collaborate with my project. I would love to include in the future: 

- Additional banks with cool sounds and effects.
- Post effects, such as reverb, distortion and loops.
- Custom sounds you can record.
- Extended layout.
- Layout customization.
